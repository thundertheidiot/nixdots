* MeowOS

Welcome to my horrifyingly convoluted NixOS configuration. This mess currently runs on my desktop (=desktop=), laptop (=t440p=), optiplex homeserver (=server=), testing laptop (=x220=) and an unused smart tv replacment (=digiboksi=). I am very creative with naming things.

** Features

At Meow Industries, our commitment to excellence is reflected in our comprehensive list of innovative features, including but not limited to: 

- [X] Modules to abstract away the abstractions provided by NixOS
- [X] Library with useless helper functions that only add extra complexity
- [X] Configuration only used by one machine represented as a module in =modules/=.
- [X] Unused and useless customization options for those modules
- [X] Modules for things I don't even use, for example gnome is a "supported" environment
- [X] Rewrites of community modules that I was slightly unsatisfied with
  - See [[file:modules/impermanence.nix][impermanence.nix]], [[file:modules/programs/discord/default.nix][discord]] or the WIP [[file:modules/browser/default.nix][browser module]]
- [X] Helper programs which could have just been scripts
  - See [[file:pkgs/screenshot/][screenshot]] or [[file:modules/tv/ir-client/][ir-client]] 
- [X] [[file:default.nix][Unfunctional flakeless build system]]
- [X] [[file:modules/home.nix][Probably useless abstraction on top of home-manager]]
  - As a bonus treat there is no consistency in the usage of home-manager or NixOS options
- [X] Bad file organization
- [?] Bad programming practices
- [X] Unreadable nix incantations
