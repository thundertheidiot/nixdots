* kodi.nix

The provided kodi package wraps kodi with LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHON_PATH, and provides an addon folder which **is not** included in the KODI_HOME path. The default nix package for kodi breaks kodi a bit, it doesn't seem to remember the extensions existing.

The intended usage is for you to symlink $out/share/kodi/addons to $KODI_HOME/addons, with for example home-manager.

* Not (yet) declaratively managed stuff
- Enable all extensions
- Set quality to 1080p in youtube enhancer settings (forces youtube.com/tv to use good quality)
